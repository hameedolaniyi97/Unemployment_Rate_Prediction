Unemployment Rate Prediction

This project aims to predict **unemployment rates** using various machine learning regression techniques, including **Decision Trees**, **Random Forest**, and **Gradient Boosting**.  
The model was trained, tuned, and evaluated to understand economic patterns and improve predictive accuracy.

Project Overview
The notebook explores:
- Data preprocessing and feature analysis  
- Model training with multiple regressors  
- Hyperparameter optimization using **GridSearchCV** and **RandomizedSearchCV**  
- Evaluation using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**  
- Comparison of model performance and insights on overfitting  

---

Techniques Used
- **DecisionTreeRegressor**
- **RandomForestRegressor**
- **GradientBoostingRegressor**
- **GridSearchCV** / **RandomizedSearchCV**
- **RMSE** as the primary evaluation metric
